# odin-recipes
An Odin practice project
This is a project to practice the HTML skills I have learned in The Odin Project Foundations program, by building a recipe website. I will practice the boilerplate, anchor and image tags, and other HTML basics. Later in the course, I'll come back and stylize it with CSS.
