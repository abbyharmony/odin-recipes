    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>These cookies are for hardcore chocolate lovers. We use an double dose of cocoa powder that keeps the texture firm and photo-worthy, while simultaneously delivering that warm dopamine rush you need.</p>
      <p>The recipe is simple, and chopped nuts are an additional option. Just try to leave enough cookie dough to actually bake with!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (125g)</li>
        <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder (65g)</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 heaping tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened (113g)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white or brown sugar (161g)</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>(optional) 1/4 cup chopped walnuts</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Sift dry ingredients in a small bowl, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cream butter and sugar together for 2-3 minutes, then add egg and vanilla and continue mixing for another minute.</li>
        <li>Using a wooden spoon, add dry ingredients to wet. The mixture will be extremely thick and a spatula will not work!</li>
        <li>Mix in chocolate chips, saving a handful for the top, and walnuts.</li>
        <li>Drop onto parchment-lined cookie sheet using a spoon, as close as you like because they will not spread. Push the leftover chocolate chips onto the tops of the cookies.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 min, then remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes on pan. They will not appear done, but trust the process!</li>
        <li>Move cookies to cooling rack using a spatula, and enjoy! Can be stored on the shelf in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
