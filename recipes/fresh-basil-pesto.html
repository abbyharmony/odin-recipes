    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Homemade pesto is about as simple as it gets, and is a great recipe for gardeners with too much basil on their hands. Feel free to sub half spinach or radish greens, too.</p>
      <p>Although we mellow the garlic by pre-roasting, feel free to throw in some raw cloves if you want to ward off vampires!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan or romano cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup pine nuts or chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>3-5 cloves roasted garlic (see below)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper, to taste</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roast garlic by cutting the top off a bulb to expose the cloves, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil and bake at 400 degrees F for 30 min.</li>
        <li>Allow the garlic to cool, then remove 3-5 cloves from their peels for the pesto. Feel free to spread remaining cloves on bread, mashed potatoes, or pasta!</li>
        <li>Place the basil and nuts into a food processor, and pulse several times.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cheese, and pulse a few more times. Scrape the sides down using a spatula.</li>
        <li>While processor is running, slowly pour in olive oil until incorporated. Or if using a closed machine, add oil and then run.</li>
        <li>Scrape down sides, add salt and pepper to taste, and pulse a few last times.</li>
        <li>Serve over pasta, bread, and more! Store in an airtight container covering surface with plastic wrap, and keep in refrigerator up to one week.</li>
    </ol>
