        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>This is an easy focaccia that can be made 1-3 days in advance, and slow-rises in the fridge. Versatile and delicious, you can top with a simple olive oil drizze and some flaky salt, or go fancy with veggie art!</p>
          <p>The recipe is insanely basic and a great option for those that are new to bread-baking. It is light, crisp and perfect for topping with whatever you like (and dunking in sauce)!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>4 cups bread flour (512g)</li>
            <li>2 tsp kosher salt (10g)</li>
            <li>2 tsp instant yeast (8g)</li>
            <li>2 cups lukewarm water (455g), about 100-110 degrees F</li>
            <li>Butter for greasing</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>salt for topping (such as flaky)</li>
            <li>toppings as desired: olives, rosemary, sliced onions, garlic, tomatoes, yellow pepper, fresh herbs, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough 1-3 days ahead.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and yeast. Mix in water with a spatula until incorporated into a sticky ball.</li>
            <li>Pour 2-4 TBSP olive oil and rub all over, turning dough to coat. Ensure top is well-oiled.</li>
            <li>Cover with lid or cloth and let sit in refrigerator for 18-72 hours.</li>
            <li>A few hours before cooking, grease a 9 x 13 pan with butter, then olive oil.</li>
            <li>Using two forks, deflate the dough by folding outside into the center, rotating the bowl 90 degrees after each fold.</li>
            <li>Place dough into greased pan and let rise for 2-4 hours (depending on temperature of kitchen) until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>Once risen in pan, preheat oven at 425 degrees F. Use oiled fingers to dimple the dough, pressing all the way down to the bottom. Top with desired toppings, and remember to drizzle olive oil over top if using veggies and herbs to prevent burn. Lastly, sprinkle with salt.</li>
            <li>Bake for 25-30 min until bottom is crispy. Remove and transfer to a cooling rack. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy with dipping sauce, and even some ricotta!</li>
